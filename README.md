# Classification Of Pokemon Sprites

In this project, we aim to classify different Pokemon
sprites utilizing the power of a convolutional neural
network. The model is trained on various types of
data, including screenshots collected from Pokemon
battles and Pokemon images found in publically
available datasets. We also make use of the OpenCV
library to process our images, as well as Pytorch and
Tensorflow for the creation of our neural network.
